1)Store raw data into hdfs location:
hadoop fs -put sales_order_data.csv /tmp

2)Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
create table sales_order_csv(ORDERNUMBER INT,
QUANTITYORDERED INT,PRICEEACH INT,ORDERLINENUMBER INT,
SALES INT,STATUS STRING,QTR_ID INT,MONTH_ID INT,YEAR_ID INT,
PRODUCTLINE STRING,MSRP INT,PRODUCTCODE STRING,
PHONE INT,CITY STRING,STATE STRING,
POSTALCODE INT,COUNTRY STRING,TERRITORY STRING,
CONTACTLASTNAME STRING,CONTACTFIRSTNAME STRING,DEALSIZE STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

3)Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/sales_order_data.csv' INTO TABLE sales_order_csv;

4) Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_order_orc(ORDERNUMBER INT,QUANTITYORDERED INT,
PRICEEACH INT,ORDERLINENUMBER INT,SALES INT,STATUS STRING,QTR_ID INT,
MONTH_ID INT,YEAR_ID INT,PRODUCTLINE STRING,MSRP INT,PRODUCTCODE STRING,
PHONE INT,CITY STRING,STATE STRING,POSTALCODE INT,COUNTRY STRING,
TERRITORY STRING,CONTACTLASTNAME STRING,CONTACTFIRSTNAME STRING,DEALSIZE STRING)
STORED AS ORC 
TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

 INSERT INTO TABLE sales_order_orc  SELECT * FROM sales_order_csv;
5)a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

5) 
a) select sum(sales),year_id  from sales_order_orc group by year_id;
b) select productcode from sales_order_orc order by quantityordered desc limit 1;
c) select sum(sales),qtr_id  from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;
d) select qtr_id from sales_order_orc order by sales asc limit 1;
e)select country from sales_order_orc order by sales asc limit 1;
select country from sales_order_orc order by sales desc limit 1;
f)  select sum(sales),qtr_id  from sales_order_orc group by city;
h) select distinct month_id, year_id from sales_order_orc order by quantityordered desc limit 1;
