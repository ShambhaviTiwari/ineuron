for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum = sum+i
    else:
        pass
print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
num1 =  int(input("Enter number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter number:"))
num3 = int(input("Enter number:"))

max = num1
if num1>num2 and num1>num3:
    print(num1)
elif num2>num1 and num2>num3:
    print(num2)
else:
    print(num3)


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
for i in numbers:
